- I used this link to figure out how to make the school name the index: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/20461165/how-to-convert-index-of-a-pandas-dataframe-into-a-column
- I referenced this link to confirm how to find the math and reading scores over 70: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/54234786/df-loc-more-than-2-conditions
- I referenced this link to figure out how to use a pivot table to calculate the math and reading schools by grade https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.pivot_table.html
- I used this link to figure out how to use the group by function to get the values for student performance based on spending range, school size, and school type: https://realpython.com/pandas-groupby/#:~:text=The%20Hello%2C%20World!%20of%20pandas%20GroupBy,-Now%20that%20you&text=You%20call%20.groupby()%20and,to%20perform%20the%20actual%20aggregation.
